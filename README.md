### 👋 A product designer by training, a product manager at heart, and continuous learner by passion — **I’m on [a mission](https://linkedin.com/in/sedakahn) to make the world's products & services more honest, purposeful, and magical.** 
#### 💫 Though educated in Oxford and Dubai, I’ve since immigrated to San Francisco, where I'm exploring how “service productisation” can be applied to  [wicked problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem)  like education, immigration, and self-development. 🤲 <br>Please reach out: [seda@sedakahn.com](mailto:seda@sedakahn.com?subject=Your%20GitHub%20Profile)
- While searching for my next adventure, I’m currently a Board Chair at the  [Stanford University Bechtel Center’s CCIS](https://bechtel.stanford.edu/). 🏛️ 
- [Previously](https://linkedin.com/in/sedakahn), I've served as a lecture translator & conference organiser in areas like AI and EdTech. I later founded language-learning startup  [Matrëshka](https://matreshkabox.com/)  to help Russian-speaking children access the English-speaking world. 🪆
- I'm also the author of  _A Very Unofficial Guide to the K-1 Visa_, a book born of my experiences navigating immigration to the United States during a time of war. ✈️ 
- Today I live in California with my husband, German-American entrepreneur  [Carson Kahn](https://github.com/carsonkahn-external), where we’re known to enjoy mushroom jerky, binging _John Oliver_, and the occasional game of Rummikub. 🀄
